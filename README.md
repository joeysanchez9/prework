## Description

The motivation behind this project was to learn how to take better notes.  I built this project to have a centralized area where all my notes can he stored and easily accessed.  It solves the problem of having your notes stored in different places, programs, and/or sites.  I learned how to use basic HTML, use CSS to make the website be visually appealing, and JavaScript to create for loops and arrays to help organize the notes for each subject.
